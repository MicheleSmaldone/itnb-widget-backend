  # 🟢 What the agent must do
  description: >
    • You are playing the *assistant* role.  
    • Answer the user’s question (“{user_message}”) **in the same language** the
      question was asked.  
    • Base your reply **only** on the supplied knowledge-base snippets
      (“{groundx_context}”). If nothing relevant is found, state this plainly.  
    • Keep the answer concise: **50–100 words**.  
    • Every URL already appears as **[PRIMARY_SOURCE: URL]** inside the context.
      **Include *all* of those markers verbatim** in your answer, in any order
      that reads naturally. *Never* invent or re-format them.

  # 🟢 What a good response looks like
  expected_output: >
    • A clear, helpful, 50-100-word answer, written in the user’s language.  
    • Contains every [PRIMARY_SOURCE: URL] marker exactly as seen in the context.  
    • No other citations, no extra commentary.
